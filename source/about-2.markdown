This humble little hideout on the internets is slowly starting to gather
some steam. If you’re reading this, then I’m lucky indeed, because I
really don’t enjoy talking to myself (despite what my co-workers may
tell you…)

At any rate, a little information about me to make this page serve its
purpose is in order. I was born in Los Angeles and have lived in
southern California my entire life. I’ve never been farther east of
Wyoming during my adult lifetime. I’m a 30-ish computer enthusiast who
is a gamer for life. My current addiction is World of Warcraft (the new
golf) and I play on one of the newer realms that was created for an
overpopulated
realm.[![Ryagas](http://sharp-eyed.org/stor/Ryagas.jpg)](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Azuremyst&n=Ryagas "Ryagas' armory page")

When I’m not raiding dungeons in Azeroth or working in real life (RL),
I’m possibly playing a console game, sharing some affection with my
neices, brothers, or parents, or perhaps I’m enjoying a book or novel
(sci-fi or fantasy, please…)

OK, that’s not everything about me, but it’s a decent taste I hope. Hope
you’ll come back soon. I do plan on keeping the dust from settling here.

**Update:** I’ve added a rather unexciting, but, possibly necessary
[disclaimer](/disclaimer "I can't afford to be sued...").

**Update (2008-09-01):** A few edits to reflect my current situation (in
RL and in WoW.)
