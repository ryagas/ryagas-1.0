I just spent a couple hours trying to figure out why my laptop would not
hop on the office network, only to suddenly be back on it a short time
after giving up and creating an illustrated page that I was going to
share with the office manager. 2 hours I'll never get back... I feel so
useless since I can't figure out why this is only affecting this machine
(my iMac is fine!)
