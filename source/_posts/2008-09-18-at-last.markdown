I've been waiting months....and months for this...

(click for larger image) I think the guild I'm in has been in The Black
Temple for quite a few months and this is only the second time I
remember this weapon dropping. The first hunter to get it is no longer
on the server (or in the guild, sadly) and I certainly didn't get it
terribly cheaply, but that didn't matter much because my DPS took a
serious boost. Goodbye, [Legacy](http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28587
"Legacy - Item - World of Warcraft")! Hello, [Halberd of
Desolation](http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32248)! Edit: Pirate-ized for
