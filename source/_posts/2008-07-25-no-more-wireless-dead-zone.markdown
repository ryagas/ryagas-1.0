I got a [Time
Capsule](http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/ "Apple - Time Capsule") this
evening after work at the local Apple Store. It was fairly easy to
setup, despite my curve-ball-throwing self using it to extend my
existing network. I had to remember to set me existing Extreme base
station to allow extending, but once I did that, I got a green light
from the capsule. After a few weeks of using the laptop on my lap for
raiding, I can finally allow things to cool off…

It’s also kinda nice that I may actually get to get back on [XBox
Live](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/ "Xbox.com | Xbox LIVE") after a
few weeks away.
