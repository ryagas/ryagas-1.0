Just when I thought I'd have to resort to desperate measures, I've
lucked up and landed a great opportunity at a new job. With the new job
comes a new host for this weblog and I'm very glad the two events are
actually related. Now, I'm fairly confident I'll actually be able to put
some serious attention into this little writing space of mine.
