Blizzcon's on the list of [7 Game Conventions to Attend Before You

That's seriously awesome. I've never been to a gaming con before, so I
feel super lucky to have scored a ticket to one of the "must-attend"
cons. I think that after this, I'll have to try going to an anime con
since I'm starting to become (been for a while?) a bit of an
[otaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku "Otaku") when it comes to
that as well. \
