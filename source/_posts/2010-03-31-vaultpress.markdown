[VaultPress](http://vaultpress.com/) Now, this looks mighty promising.
Premium Wordpress blog backup service. I'm keeping my eyes open.
[spotted at [daring fireball](http://daringfireball.net/)] Update: I got
a @reply to my tweet from what looks like a competitor,
[blogVault](http://blogvault.net/), offering the same type of service.
Competition could be good.
