If you could choose only two movies to watch ever again, what would they
be? **This is a really tough question. I love quite a few movies. Only
two? Alright…*Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn* and *Much Ado About
Nothing***

What have you found to be the best way to relieve tension? **Relaxing
with a good book.**

If you went to a beach and it turned out to be a nude beach, would you
stay and go swimming? Would you swim nude? **I don’t normally swim at
beaches, so I might stay, but not swim.**
