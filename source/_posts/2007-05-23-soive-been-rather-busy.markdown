I've been working hard (also known as [hardly
working](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_space)) for the past couple
of months at my new job. For the 2 people reading this, you know what I
do and where, but for the rest, I'll say this not-so-vague thing that
still doesn't just put it all out there: I work in tech support (no, I
will not fix your computer...). Yeah, it never feels exciting when I
just say it, but I feel almost like I've hit a jackpot. What am I
saying? I've hit a jackpot in Vegas before and let me tell you...$80
worth of quarters dropping sure is mighty fun...I did the "yeah....it's
me..." head nod for a while...

Anyways, I haven't just been working the last couple of months since my
[last
post](http://sharp-eyed.org/2007/03/its-been-a-fun-week/ "waaaay baaaack when...").
I've also been in school with one class this semester. Am I lazy? A bit.
It's true that I've got
[senioritus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senioritus) bad, but it was
hard paying for school this semester since I was unemployed for over a
month (my textbook was an overdue interlibrary loan, that's how tight my
money was). After this semester, I really have no excuse not to do well
in school and maybe even finish during my own lifetime. The course this
spring: Software Engineering. Seriously, that course could live in its
own semester. Well, not really, but it would be nice to have one 16 unit
course. Now that finals (final) are over once again, I can sleep in on
my days off from work (oops, I work full time!) It's [not all
work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee "turn off all powerups but hammers for fun times!"),
however (even at work...only during breaks, of course!) I still am an
avid gamer and World of Warcraft player (elaboration: I'm a core raider
in an end-game raiding guild.) After the usual and not entirely
unexpected post-expansion guild
[meltdown](http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/22/guildwatch-trouble-at-the-top/),
[splintering](http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/04/25/guildwatch-a-long-struggle-with-raid-cancer/),
and inevitable reformation, things seem to be progressing somewhat again
at their normal pace. The old guild master absorbed the spin-off guild I
was in for a while after being away for a while getting prepared for a
wedding to another member and we've nearly completed our current raid
objective, the
[potentially-guild-destroying](http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/14/officers-quarters-surviving-karazhan/)
[Karazhan](http://www.wowwiki.com/Karazhan) 10-man raid dungeon. Both of
our raid teams progressed to the "final" boss of the dungeon, but a
known glitch caused neither group to be able to kill [Prince
Malchezaar](http://www.wowwiki.com/Prince_Malchezaar "Prince Malchezaar").
Much cursing ensued on Monday night, the evening before the dungeon
reset and also, before the latest patch is applied (coincidence, I think
not...) Now, we'll be spending the next couple of days sorting out
post-patch wackiness and also preparing to once again take on the
Prince. The next time we fight him, we hope to be celebrating the
[phat](http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28581)
[loots](http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30480) that a clear of Kara can
bring (I'm ready for [tier 4 gear](http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=651),
are you?).
