I was just thinking that if I had to list out things I would like to
learn, it might look like the following. In no particular order, here
are... 10 things I'd like to learn 1. To pilot a real airplane 2. To
play guitar 3. To play piano 4. Japanese 5. Chinese 6. (Fluent) Perl 7.
To draw 8. Sign language 9. Who's a great match for me 10. If Earth is
being visited...and by whom...
