[BigRedKitty Podcast Episode
One](http://www.bigredkitty.net/2008/08/31/bigredkitty-podcast-episode-one/)
: It was a very good first episode! I already subscribe to the feed, but
I'll try and add it in iTunes for a convenient way to get the future
episodes (of which I hope for many.) He's far too modest (I knew it!
He's got [some serious
skills](http://www.bigredkitty.net/2008/09/01/how-it-all-came-together/).)
I've dabbled in Garageband myself, and while it's a great app, it's not
super easy to use. His video-editing skills seem to have translated to
the audio side of things pretty well. Even though lots of things in beta
are "borked" at this point, I still hope I get a beta key soon. I'd like
to try out other hunter specs without the pain of respec costs (a
semi-hardcore raider's gotta conserve gold as much as possible...) and
I'd like to take a Deathknight for a spin as well. I hope episode 2
comes soon. Rawr!
