Since the realms are currently down due to some mailbox issues (I have
immense sympathy for the Blizzard IT guys...), I thought I'd begin
making a list of things to do when you're in the game, but otherwise
can't be doing the things you usually do in the game (quest, level
professions, gather mats, etc.) due to the crush of players that are
going to hit Northrend and the Death Knight starting areas. This list
will probably grow over time since there's at least one maintenance
period a week in WoW. Here goes... *Work on easy Achievements* That’s
right. Some achievements don’t involve killing a single monster (or
critter.) For example, if I ever find some idle time, I’ll work on:

-   [To All The Squirrels I’ve loved
    Before](http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1206 "To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before - Achievement - World of Warcraft")
    - There’s even [a handy guide by
    BBR](http://rrvs.blogspot.com/2008/11/search-and-find.html "Random Ravings of Warcraft: Search and Find")
    at Random Ravings.
-   [Classic Dungeon
    Master](http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1283 "Classic Dungeonmaster - Achievement - World of Warcraft")
    - Yes, part of this one involves invading an opposite faction’s
    capital city, but once you’re in the instances, they are relatively
    easy to clear (and usually solo-able). A small group can quickly do
    the higher-level dungeons.
-   Explore! Visit those
    [nooks](http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=42 "Explore Eastern Kingdoms - Achievement - World of Warcraft")
    and
    [crannies](http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=43 "Explore Kalimdor - Achievement - World of Warcraft")
    of Azeroth and
    [Outland](http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=44 "Explore Outland - Achievement - World of Warcraft")
    that you may have missed. uncover those fogged-out areas on your
    maps. It’s kind of relaxing, in a way…
-   Level up a lowbie alt \*

I’m probably going to see very little of
[Northrend](http://www.wowhead.com/?maps=-5 "Maps - World of Warcraft")
during the first week or so after the expansion drops since I really
don’t want to let the lag and spawn-camping slow me down. I went through
it when the [Burning
Crusade](http://www.wowwiki.com/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade - WoWWiki - Your guide to the World of Warcraft")
dropped, and it’s simply a buzz-kill. Working on an alt can also be
relaxing too because of the lower number of players in those “old-world”
zones.

-   Do something other than play WoW \*

Yeah, yeah. This one is actually a tricky one. However, I’ve got games
on consoles systems, for example, that I haven’t cracked open yet.
Playing them could be fun… Or, I could maybe go out and see a movie or
something. Having friends outside WoW can make for a good social event
during those evenings when playing WoW isn’t fun.
