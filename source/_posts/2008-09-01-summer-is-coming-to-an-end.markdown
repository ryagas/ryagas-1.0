For all my fellow Americans, I wish you all a happy and safe Labor Day!

> Labor Day, the first Monday in September, is a creation of the labor
> movement and is dedicated to the social and economic achievements of
> American workers. It constitutes a yearly national tribute to the
> contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and
> well-being of our country.
