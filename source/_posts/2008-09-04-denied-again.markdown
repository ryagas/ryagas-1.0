I've forgotten how many times I've seen [High Warlord
Naj'Entus](http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22887 "High Warlord Naj'entus -
NPC - World of Warcraft") downed, but it must have been more than a
couple dozen. [Halberd of Desolation](http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32248
"Halberd of Desolation - Item - World of Warcraft") has only dropped
once since I've been visiting the [Black
Temple](http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3959 "Black Temple - Zone - World
of Warcraft"). My mantra for now remains "maybe next week the dice roll
will be favorable..." Good thing this is the first boss in the instance
or I would seriously get back into arena. If I'd only have known it
would take so long. It hasn't beaten Legacy as the most annoying drop
for me though. I'd have to get it after we get
[Sunwell](http://www.wowwiki.com/Sunwell\_Plateau "Sunwell Plateau -
WoWWiki - Your guide to the World of Warcraft") on farm first. That's
not happening for a while yet. It won't be too long though, compared to
this wait.
