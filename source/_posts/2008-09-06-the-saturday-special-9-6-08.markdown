[The Saturday Special](http://satspecial.blogspot.com/): \
 \~My Favorite DVD Movie Is\~ 1. In Drama? \*\*Stand By Me\*\*. The
believability of the characters is what I remember (I was around the
same age as the characters at the time.) 2. In Comedy? \*\*Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective\*\*. I saw this at a pre-release screening. I \*wore out\*
that VHS tape from playing it so much. Allllllllrighty then! 3. In
Mystery/Suspense? \*\*Seven\*\*. I'm almost afraid to mention it. 4. In
Action/Adventure? \*\*The Matrix\*\*. It's going to take a \*lot\* to
topple this movie off the top of my must-have DVDs list. \
