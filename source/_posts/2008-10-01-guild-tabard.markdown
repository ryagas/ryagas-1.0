As Blizzcon draws nearer, I'm happy to see that my guild tabard from the
folks at [Swagdog.com](http://swagdog.com) has arrived! I'll wear it at
the conference so that any guildies looking to find me can do so. I
think this is the first custom-made t-shirt, I've ever ordered. It looks
pretty well made. [caption id="attachment\_182" align="alignleft"

Yeah. I'm pretty die-hard when it comes to WoW...
