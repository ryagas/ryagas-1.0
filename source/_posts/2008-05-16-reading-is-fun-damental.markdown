A post begun long ago is finally finished! [Five Books Every Geek Should
Read](http://suicidegirls.com/news/geek/18934/) I'm embarrassed to say I
haven't experienced 2 1 of the books on the list Wil posted on
[SG](http://www.suicidegirls.com "SuicideGirls - not safe for work site").
The comments are great on his post because many books I like and might
even check out are there. This is an example of a good blog post that I
want to keep handy for times when I run out of things to read (I read
series and come to the end...)
