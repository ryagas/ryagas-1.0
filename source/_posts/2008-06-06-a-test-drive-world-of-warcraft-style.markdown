I was doing a few of the daily quests trying to grind up to a
[netherdrake mount](http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32857) and I thought to
myself, what if I could take my loaner mount out for a test drive? So, I
flew over to the [Black Temple](http://www.wowwiki.com/Black_Temple) and
escorted [Majev](http://www.wowwiki.com/Maiev) and
[Akama](http://www.wowwiki.com/Akama) in. Then I took a flight over to
[Shattrath City](http://www.wowdb.com/location.aspx?id=3703). I think
I'll hang onto this hot ride for a few days.
