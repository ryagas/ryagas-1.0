David Nelson over at [WoW Insider](http://www.wowinsider.com) asks us
the question, do we think of [World of
Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) as a game like console or
computer games or as a hobby, such as (please don't groan...) golf?
While I don't golf, I do play games other than WoW, like console games.
If there's ever an extended downtime on my realm, I will sometimes turn
on one of my old consoles, such as my Playstation, Gamecube, or XBox,
and try and make some progress in one of the games there. I've got a few
console games I haven't finished for whatever reason and I get an itch
sometimes to pick them up. I've got to say I think of WoW as a serious
hobby. With the time and money I've spent on WoW and will spend,
eventually, it's going to approach, or pass, the amount I spent on
console gaming. The only other game I've spent a huge amount of time on
previously for such a long period was Diablo II (yeah, Blizzard has
[pwned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn) me good...) Now, if you'll
excuse me, [Chrono Cross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Cross) is
calling. [Breakfast Topic: Game or Hobby? - WOW
