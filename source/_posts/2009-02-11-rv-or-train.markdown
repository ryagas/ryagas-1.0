It's been quite a while since I went on a long trip. The last
out-of-state trip I took was last summer's family trip to Vegas, but the
last multi-state trip I was on was nearly a decade ago. Vegas is a
decent hop from Southern California, but I've been thinking a longer
trip would be fun. I've yet to really experience the east coast of this
country, so that would be a trip I'd like to plan out and go on for a
long vacation. How do I get there? It would be a super long drive and
perhaps an RV rental would be fun, but I'd likely be taking a solo trip,
so a train trip or flight is what I'm thinking. I don't mind flying, but
I've never been on a cross-country train ride. That's what I'd rather
travel in for a long trip. What about you?
