I certainly wouldn’t be the first, nor the best to write this post, but
I think I’ve got a solid basis to, so I’ll tackle it. Keep in mind I’m
not saying there’s a set order you should explore anime, or that some
are more difficult to follow than others, just trying to make the ride,
initially, as free from jarring changes as possible.

A friend asked about “The Big 3”, which is, arguably, what many in the
U.S. think of when somebody mentions anime. His three were:

1.  [Robotech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech)
2.  [Voltron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron)
3.  [Battle of The
    Planets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_The_Planets) (aka
    G-Force)

Now, as a kid, I watched all three of these. I actually tried to
carefully follow Robotech, but I had other childhood pursuits (i.e.
video games) to occupy my time. I each case, and why these 3 are
important, the series named above are “Americanized” versions of some
classic anime. What do I mean by that? It means there was not just
translation, but usually, (and notably in the case of Robotech), heavy
editing of, and shortening sometimes (Robotech vs Macross, for example)
the original storyline.

**Macross**

It is to Robotech what Avatar: The Last Airbender is to M. Night
Shamalan’s The last Airbender (rough analogy since the more recent movie
had no translation to do.) One is great, and the other…we’ll…not so
good. They have the same story, however, sorta. If you say you like
Robotech, to a fan of anime, you’ll either get a frown of dismay, or an
understanding nod and recommendation to go see Macross. So, I’ll be the
latter: go see Macross. It really is a good story. It’s best to see it
as it was meant to be; in its original form (sorry you’ll have to become
a good reader of dubs or learn Japanese.)

**Voltron**

I liked the lions *and* the vehicles (lol at me if you want.) AND I’LL
FORM THE HEAD! This one’s special because it was a combo effort between
a Japanese and American team to adapt two animes, Beast King Go-Lion and
Armored Fleet Dairugger XV. That’s why it felt like two different series
to most of us who watched it. I didn’t learn that for quite a few years.
I actually haven’t watched the originals yet. Someday, I will.

**Battle of The Planets**

took me a sec to realize he meant the Americanized version of Science
Ninja Team Gatchaman, which, aka Battle of the Planets (one of my
favorites as a kid!) As with Macross, this may be a bit of an odd
sensation to watch the original since there will be some differences. I
must confess, I need to take a look at this one again too.

There’s a lot (LOT) of great anime you might have heard of, but should
see if you like those 3. They are key ones, for sure. Just see the
original Japanese versions, please. Here’s a few that you might also
hear commonly, in case you want a good foundation:

-   [Neon Genesis
    Evangelion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_(anime))
    (or Eva, for short) - Considered a classic by many. If you like
    giant robots defending Earth, this one should be on your list.
-   [Suzumiya Haruhi no
    Yuuutsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhi_Suzumiya#Anime) (The
    Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) - I admit I would not have seen this
    when I did if it weren’t for the popularity of it’s ending song,
    [Hare Hare Yukai](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5G5bD2Do-k). Check
    it out, if you haven’t already, and keep in mind the series is
    actually very good:

-   [Golden Boy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Boy_(manga)#OVA)
-   [Love Hina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Hina#Anime)

If you've heard of
[Bleach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(manga)#Anime) or
[Naruto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto#Anime_series), then I
strongly urge you to still give them a shot. Both have their ups and
downs, but there's some really good plotlines in both. They're popular
(might be a good or bad thing), but they do deserve credit for having
good production quality. In case I didn't mention it before, see them
subbed. Crunchyroll has both and that is good quality subbing.

This is by no means a definitive guide to anime. I'm not entirely sure
one exists, but I hope that's OK. I like to explore a bit, although I'll
be pretty busy in my favorite genres for quite a while I think.
Hopefully, I won't be alone in my exploration.
