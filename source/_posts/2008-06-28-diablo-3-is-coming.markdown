[Blizzard introduces Diablo 3 -
Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/06/28/blizzard-introduces-diablo-3/)
That's all well and good (very, very good...), but you might want to see
some
[screenshots](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/06/28/here-are-the-first-diablo-3-screenshots/)
or even some
[video](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/06/28/watch-diablo-3-teaser-and-gameplay-footage/).
\
 ...and for a short time, it all stopped.All fanboys-alike gave up on
flame wars and hugged each other.They all watched as Blizzard announced
Diablo 3 and tried to make the best out of their one-day-truce. \

Good thing there's still a [Mac
