The [WoW](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ "WorldofWarcraft.com") guild
I'm an officer in,
[Sanctity](http://sanctityguild.com/ "Sanctity Guild - A Azuremyst World of Warcraft Guild")
(US-Azuremyst) downed [Lady
Vashj](http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21212 "Lady Vashj - NPC - World of Warcraft")
this evening for our guild's first downing of her. It was very fun,
especially since the team vibes were flowing. For those who understand
the fight, it's also interesting to note that one of the [tainted
elementals](http://www.wowwiki.com/Lady_Vashj_(tactics) "Lady Vashj (tactics) - WoWWiki - Your guide to the World of Warcraft")
unfortunately de-spawned (really bad luck that a strider came at the
exact same time and place as the elemental) on us, making phase 2 a tad
long, but the team persevered and prevailed. Screenshot after the jump.

I had fun trying to hit the spore bats in phase 3 as a [BM
hunter](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Azuremyst&n=Ryagas "The World of Warcraft Armory")!
