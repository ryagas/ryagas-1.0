If you're a raiding hunter in the World of Warcraft, this article is a
very good read: [BigRedKitty: Channeling Larry King - WOW
Insider](http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/09/17/bigredkitty-channeling-larry-king/):

Now, while many classes seem worried and anxious about how drastically
they're going to change in the upcoming expansion, it seems the
nerf-hammer has been mercifully not heavily applied to us hunters. I,
for one, missed being a raiding Marksmanship hunter and do not cringe in
fear at the thought that \*gasp\*, my DPS will depend on my skill at
weaving shots again, even as a BM hunter... \> Since the The Age of the
Raiding Macro-Masher could be over, the DPS of your average hunter
versus the other DPS classes will probably decrease. Whereas hunters
used to dominate almost all pre-Tier 6 DPS charts, the frequency that a
hunter will get the top spot will decrease, as more skill will be
required to maximize our potential. Skill \> Gear, and WotLK is going to
prove that for our class.

As much as I liked being at the top of the DPS charts, being a \_macro
masher\_ was not as exciting as the old days of anxiously timing
cooldowns to get the perfect shot rotation to work (if a \_perfect\_ one
existed, I didn't find it...) Again, I'd rather work on actually being a
\_skilled\_ hunter than a one-button killing machine. Just like when I
knew I was going to respec to BM, it was for raid usefulness, and I'm
sure any future respec (even back to BM) for the expansion will still
allow me to have fun with whatever play style I choose. I might even
dabble with Survival for leveling. Who knows? I think I'll have to play
around with the different specs in the PTR (and beta, if I can get a
key...) For now, I'm not gonna be a "Wrath-Freaked" hunter.
